Geo-GDAL
=======================

This is the swig-generated Perl interface to the GDAL/OGR library. The
same one, which is distributed with GDAL. GDAL is available from
www.gdal.org. This is based on the GDAL 1.3.2, the difference is that
the module names are here changed to the Geo namespace.

You need to have the development (header files etc.) versions of gdal and
geos libraries available in your system to build these modules.

This module is _not_ compatible with Geo::GDAL 0.11
